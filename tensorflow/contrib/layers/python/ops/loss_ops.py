"""## Loss operations for use in neural networks.

The loss ops measure error for use in neural networks. These losses
can be used for measuring accuracy of a network in a regression task
or for regularization purposes (e.g., weight decay).

These loss ops are, by design, minimal, enabling flexibility in how
their output can be used.
