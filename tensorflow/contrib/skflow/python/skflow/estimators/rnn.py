class TensorFlowRNNClassifier(TensorFlowEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    """TensorFlow RNN Classifier model.

    Parameters:
        rnn_size: The size for rnn cell, e.g. size of your word embeddings.
        cell_type: The type of rnn cell, including rnn, gru, and lstm.
        num_layers: The number of layers of the rnn model.
        input_op_fn: Function that will transform the input tensor, such as
                     creating word embeddings, byte list, etc. This takes
                     an argument X for input and returns transformed X.
        bidirectional: boolean, Whether this is a bidirectional rnn.
        sequence_length: If sequence_length is provided, dynamic calculation is performed.
                 This saves computational time when unrolling past max sequence length.
        initial_state: An initial state for the RNN. This must be a tensor of appropriate type
                       and shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
        n_classes: Number of classes in the target.
        tf_master: TensorFlow master. Empty string is default for local.
        batch_size: Mini batch size.
        steps: Number of steps to run over data.
        optimizer: Optimizer name (or class), for example "SGD", "Adam",
                   "Adagrad".
        learning_rate: If this is constant float value, no decay function is used.
            Instead, a customized decay function can be passed that accepts
            global_step as parameter and returns a Tensor.
            e.g. exponential decay function:
            def exp_decay(global_step):
                return tf.train.exponential_decay(
                    learning_rate=0.1, global_step,
                    decay_steps=2, decay_rate=0.001)
        class_weight: None or list of n_classes floats. Weight associated with
                     classes for loss computation. If not given, all classes are suppose to have
                     weight one.
        tf_random_seed: Random seed for TensorFlow initializers.
            Setting this value, allows consistency between reruns.
        continue_training: when continue_training is True, once initialized
            model will be continuely trained on every call of fit.
        num_cores: Number of cores to be used. (default: 4)
        max_to_keep: The maximum number of recent checkpoint files to keep.
            As new files are created, older files are deleted.
            If None or 0, all checkpoint files are kept.
            Defaults to 5 (that is, the 5 most recent checkpoint files are kept.)
        keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours: Number of hours between each checkpoint
            to be saved. The default value of 10,000 hours effectively disables the feature.
